# Rest API
- if you want to send state of object as jason/xml.
- we can send request and get reponse
- A RESTful API is an architectural style for an application program interface (API) that uses HTTP requests to access and use data. That data can be used to GET, PUT, POST and DELETE data types, which refers to the reading, updating, creating and deleting of operations concerning resources
- jersey & Sparing for implentation 
-  ## HTTP Method
 + C -> Create -> POST

# Jersey
-JAX-RS is an specification (just a definition) and Jersey is a JAX-RS implementation. Jersey framework is more than the JAX-RS Reference Implementation. Jersey provides its own API that extend the JAX-RS toolkit with additional features and utilities to further simplify RESTful service and client development.
